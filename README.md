# Multiresolution Streamgraph to Explore Hierarchical Time Series
### A new approah to convey the hierarchical structure of multiple time series
Authors: ADVANSE team at LIRMM

## Introduction

Our approach extends a [Streamgraph](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/ "Streamgraph") to convey the hierarchical structure of multiple time series. 
Thus, facilitate the exploration of temporal evolution in time series.
Based on a focus+context technique, our method allows time series exploration at different granularities (e.g. from overview to details). 


## Datasets available
* Sentiment analysis of political events:
	- 2016 US presidential election day.
	- 2016 US second presidential debate.
	- 2013 Australian presidential period.
* Sentiment analysis of sporting events:
	- 2016 UEFA Champions league final.
	- 2014 Rugby union match.
* Other datasets:
	- Music genres evolution.


## Web technologies used
* HTML
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/ "D3.js") / JavaScript
* CSS

## Getting the code
The code is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/erickedu85/multiresolution-streamgraph "Github")

Get the last version of this approach with:

	$ git clone https://github.com/erickedu85/multiresolution-streamgraph
	$ cd multiresolution-streamgraph
	

## Using
* Copy the files from the git repository to your web server (e.g. [HTTP Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/ "HTTP Apache Server"))
